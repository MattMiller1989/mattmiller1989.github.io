# Time for a break
This semester was a doozy. But i got through it well enough and should get fairly decent grades. I plan on taking it easy for about a week and play a lot of Halo: Master Chief Collection. After that, it will be time to create a new portfolio site and update my resume. Once that is done i will probably spend the rest of my break applying for internships and grinding out leetcode. I will most likely not start on any new crazy project, and spend the time working on previous projects to make them more portfolio worthy.

Chaire,
MM
