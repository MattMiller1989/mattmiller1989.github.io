# New Project

My first project for the semester went well enough. I will say that i had to spend WAAAAYYYY too much time trying to figure out things that were directly related to the syntax of C++. If i had chosen to write the code in Ruby or in Java, i would have not had the same difficulties. I will say that it was definitely a learning experience and i am much more comfortable using C++. I failed to properly lay out the architecture of the project and had to spend a lot of time back tracking and fixing errors from things that i did not properly test from a previous step.


For the new project, i have to use Binary Trees to properly encode and decode morse code

This project seems relatively easy compared to the last one. We have had several assignments covering trees.
