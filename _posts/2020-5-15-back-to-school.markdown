# Back to School
I have kinda kept this on the down low, but it looks like i will be going back to school to finish my degree. I have been accepted into UMKC's Computer Science program and i will be able to start this summer. I am very excited to have this opportunity. I will do my best to keep this blog updated with my school projects and life updates but i will definitely be busy for the next year and a half.

I am hoping to be able to keep up with my side projects, but i am starting in data structures and from everything i have heard, it is a very tough class.


Wish me luck guys!!!


Chaire,

MM
