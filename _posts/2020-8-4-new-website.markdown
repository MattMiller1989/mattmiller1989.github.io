# A little more professional
I went ahead and finished my website today. I was initially going to use rails to deploy my new site, but since this site will primarily be static, i decided to use Jekyll. Jekyll seems much simpler to maintain that a full fledged ruby on rails app. I will also be able to quickly update things directly from the github repo without have to worry about cloning and updating anything on my local machine. 

One of the things that i am still working on is trying to figure out the best way to deploy some of my strictly Ruby apps onto the site. Most of my Ruby apps are command-line only so the two options are to directly put a version of the command prompt into the web browser or i could get REALLY fancy and turn them into full-fledge web apps. If i do decide to start on another programming project, i definitely want to make something with C++. One of the ideas i had was to make a Discord bot that acted as a sort of stock ticker that can be used to alert users of significant dips and rises in certain volatile stocks.


# Job Hunt 

Since i graduate in December of 2021, i will only have one opportunity for a summer internship. I am going to start sending out my resume to companies. In addition to that, i recently picked up a copy of "Cracking the Coding Interview". I will be spending a lot of time going through that and i will make sure to be more active on the blog and actually go through some of the problems laid out in the book.



# Much Thanks
The basic layout of my site was inspired by github user [Tauseef Jamadar](https://github.com/tmjam)
