# Who am I?
Hello, My name is `Matt Miller`, i am an aspiring software engineer from Kansas City, MO. For as long as i can remember, i have had a passion for technology. I was given a Sega Genesis for Christmas one year, and was in immediate awe of the power of computing. Both of my parents have a strong science background and have always encouraged me to engage my curiosity. 

# My Journey

I first started coding when i was a sophmore in high school. I was lucky enough to attend a high school that offered Computer Science as an elective. I took two years of Computer Science and i can still remember the satisfaction from successfully using recursion to solve the Towers of Hanoi problem.

I initially began my college career pursuing Electrical Engineering at Texas Tech University in Lubbock, Texas. While I learned a great deal and enjoyed using science to solve problems, the passion was simply not there. Unfortunately, I dropped out before completing my degree. It was at this time when I began to pursue a degree in the hospitality industry. 

I began working at the Alamo Drafthouse shortly after dropping out of college. I have always loved movies, and this presented me the opportunity to work directly around them. The work was by no means easy. The hours were long, the work was hard. But I had the privilege of working with an awesome group of people. I managed to work my way from a server, to a traveling trainer, to a shift supervisor, and to my current position, as a 4-wall operations manager. 

# Back to Coding!

In November of 2019, I was looking at the future of jobs and technology. I decided that software development was the job of the future, and that I needed to get involved with it. Even though it had been over 7 years since i had written a line of code, the passion and the fascination almost immediately came back. I started this blog to share my successes and my failures with the world! If you have any advice or have any questions. Or... you want to simply laugh at my struggle, please reach out and leave a comment.

Chaire,
MM
