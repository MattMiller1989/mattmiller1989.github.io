# Even More Time

I mentioned in some previous blog entry posts about how i longed for more time to work on coding. Well today i got my wish. I was furloughed from my job due to COVID-19. I guess people don't want to be crammed into a movie theater during a pandemic. This is of course scary, but luckiy i am well prepared and i am in a better position than most to weather the storm. This is an opportunity for me to SERIOUSLY get into my coding projects. This is a very scary time for a lot of people in the world, myself included. The only thing that i can control is how i spend my time. I want to be able to look back on this time in ten years and be proud of myself and how i spent my time.

I am stocked up on groceries. One of the benefits of being on lockdown is that i will have ZERO excuse to deviate from my diet. I am going to take advantage of my kitchen and my recently discovered culinary skills. One of the unintended benefits of working at the Alamo is that i routinely walked 20,000 steps in a day and burnt an absurd number of calories simply doing my job. I will have to dial back the amount of calories i consume. I am going to try to get back into running. I will, of course, have to be aware of social distancing. In addition to my place of employment being shut down, all of the gyms in the country have temporarily shut down. I was lucky enough to snag some resistance bands at Target. I am going to have to get creative and switch from a traditional weight lifting program to more of a "prison" style workout. 

# CODE CODE CODE CODE

This is the time to get SERIOUS about my coding. My plan is to treat this as if it were a full time job. My first big project on the agenda is to make a movie reccomendation similar to Netflix. I am going to continue to use JAVA, as that is the language i am most comfortable with.


# Stay tuned

This blog will serve as a way to keep me sane during quarantine and it will also help keep me honest and hold me accountable with achieving my programming goals.


Chaire,

MM
