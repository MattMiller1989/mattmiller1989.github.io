# I am still alive
Hello friends, it has been a while since i have updated the blog but i have been pretty busy with summer school. Data structures is definitely designed to be a weed-out class. This is made even more challenging by the current state of education and the fact that this semester is 100% remote. I am super thankful that i have spent the last 3 months grinding super hard on the progamming projects. A lot of the subjects discussed in Data structures are things that were covered in The Odin Project. 

# More Praise for My Friend Abdul
Just like the beginning of TOP and it's section on Data Structures. I have leaned on the wisdom and teachings of my friend [Abdul](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZCFT11CWBi3MHNlGf019nw). Whenever i google a question about Data structures, his channel is the first thing that pops up.


# My first project

For my first project of my "second" college career, i have to create my own priority queue class for use in creating a system that tracks the [circulation of books](https://github.com/MattMiller1989/Book-Circulation). The hardest thing about this project will be that it is all done in C++. It has been a good ten years since i have coded in C++ but i guess this will be a great opportunity to relearn.
